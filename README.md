Help Needed: CommunityBot Chatbot Project
I am working on a chatbot project called CommunityBot, designed to help users engage with their local community. However, I’m encountering issues with certain aspects of the bot, and I would appreciate any help or suggestions to make it work better.

Current Issues
Incorrect Responses: The bot is not providing accurate or relevant responses to user queries. Even after training, the output is inconsistent, and the bot doesn’t always respond correctly.
Training Data: Despite having a properly structured dataset (intents.json), the chatbot struggles to match user inputs with the right responses.
Integration with Model: I’m facing issues with integrating the trained model (chatbot_model.h5) with the bot's interactive logic. Some of the responses seem random or off-topic.
General Performance: The chatbot doesn’t seem to perform well with more complex or varied user inputs. I need guidance on improving its response accuracy.
Goal
I am looking for assistance with:

Improving Response Accuracy: How can I fine-tune the model or training process to improve accuracy and response relevance?
Fixing Model Integration: Help with properly integrating the trained model and ensuring it works seamlessly in predicting and matching responses.
Enhancing User Interaction: Suggestions for making the chatbot more interactive and capable of handling various user queries, especially when it comes to community-related topics.
Debugging: Assistance in troubleshooting any issues or errors that might be preventing the chatbot from working as expected.
Project Files
Here are the main files for the project:

intents.json: Contains the data with tags, patterns, and responses used to train the model.
chatbot.py: The main script for running the chatbot and interacting with users.
train_chatbot.py: Script for training the model using the data in intents.json.
chatbot_model.h5: The trained machine learning model file.
words.pkl and classes.pkl: Files containing tokenized words and classes used in training.
Steps to Reproduce the Issue
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
Run the training script (train_chatbot.py).
After training, run the chatbot script (chatbot.py).
Observe that the chatbot provides incorrect or irrelevant responses to user queries.
What I Have Tried
I have already trained the model using the data in intents.json, but the bot still provides inaccurate responses.
I have attempted to adjust the ERROR_THRESHOLD and training settings, but I haven’t been able to achieve better results.
I’ve checked the code for errors, but the issue seems to be with how the model is integrated or how the responses are matched.
How You Can Help
Debugging: Please help me debug the chatbot's prediction and response functions.
Suggestions for Improvement: Any recommendations on improving the training dataset or model to enhance the accuracy of responses.
Code Review: A thorough review of the code, particularly the chatbot.py and train_chatbot.py files, to spot any issues in logic or structure.
